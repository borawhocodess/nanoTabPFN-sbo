# nanoTabPFN

The purpose of this repository is to provide a fully open source playground for tabular foundation models.
It contains a much smaller and simpler implementation of the TabPFNv2 architecture as well as a training loop and code for loading data that was pre-generated by a prior. We are planning to rapidly extend the repository with more features (e.g. regression, missing values, categorical features), prior interfaces and architectures.
It is supposed to be a good starting point for students and researchers that are interested in learning about how TabPFN works under the hood.

Clone the repository, afterwards install dependencies via:
```
pip install -e .
```

We offer the same interface as TabPFN:
```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, roc_auc_score
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

from nanotabpfn import NanoTabPFNClassifier

# Load data
X, y = load_breast_cancer(return_X_y=True)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.5, random_state=42)

# Initialize a classifier
clf = NanoTabPFNClassifier(n_estimators=4, temperature=0.9)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict probabilities
prediction_probabilities = clf.predict_proba(X_test)
print("ROC AUC:", roc_auc_score(y_test, prediction_probabilities[:, 1]))

# Predict labels
predictions = clf.predict(X_test)
print("Accuracy", accuracy_score(y_test, predictions))
```

The `n_estimators` parameter activates a lightweight ensemble that averages predictions over several feature permutations (and label permutations for classification), following the ensemble strategy described in the original TabPFN work. A temperature parameter is also available to calibrate the predicted probabilities.

### Our Code

`nanotabpfn/model.py` contains the implementation of the architecture in less than 250 lines of code. `nanotabpfn/train.py` implements a simple training loop in under 100 lines and `nanotabpfn/priors.py` implements a dataloader that allows you to load a dump pre-generated from a prior.
We will release multiple dumps of different scales soon. We also offer an interface where you can provide your own get\_batch function.

### Pretrain your own small nanoTabPFN
First we download 100k pre-generated datasets with 50 datapoints, 3 features and up to 3  classes each from [here](https://ml.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/research-artifacts/pfefferle/nanoTabPFN/50x3_3_100k_classification.h5).

or download pre-generated datasets by running:
```
python scripts/dumps.py --download
```

Then you can run:
```
python pretrain_classification.py -epochs 80 -steps 25 -batchsize 50 -priordump 50x3_3_100k_classification.h5
```
This should take less than 5 min on a modern NVIDIA GPU (around 10 minutes on Macbook M4 Pro GPU and around 40 min on M4 Pro CPU).

We also offer a pre-generated dataset containing 1.28M tables with 50 datapoints and 3 features each for regression [here](https://ml.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/research-artifacts/pfefferle/nanoTabPFN/50x3_1280k_regression.h5).

You can pretrain on it using `python pretrain_regressor.py`.

#### Step by Step Explanation (Classifier)

First we import our Architecture, Prior interface and training loop, etc.
```python
from nanotabpfn.model import NanoTabPFNModel
from nanotabpfn.priors import PriorDumpDataLoader
from nanotabpfn.train import train
from nanotabpfn.utils import get_default_device
from nanotabpfn.interface import NanoTabPFNClassifier
from torch.nn import CrossEntropyLoss
from nanotabpfn.callbacks import ConsoleLoggerCallback
```
then we instantiate our model and loss criterion:
```python
model = NanoTabPFNModel(
    num_attention_heads=6,
    embedding_size=192,
    mlp_hidden_size=768,
    num_layers=6,
    num_outputs=10,
)
criterion = CrossEntropyLoss()
```
then we instantiate our prior:
```python
device = get_default_device()
prior = PriorDumpDataLoader(filename='50x3_3_100k_classification.h5', num_steps=25, batch_size=50, device=device)
```
and finally train our model:
```python
trained_model, loss = train(
    model=model,
    prior=prior,
    criterion=criterion,
    epochs=80,
    device=device,
    callbacks=[ConsoleLoggerCallback()]
)
```
